    "\n",
    "There are exactly 100 sneaker shops on a sneaker retailing website, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n",

    "**Questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What went wrong with this metric and our analysis? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Propose some new metrics that better represents the behavior of the stores' customers. Why are these metrics better? You can propose as many new metrics as you wish but quality heavily outweights quantity.\n",

    "- Find the values of your new metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Report any other interesting findings.\n",
